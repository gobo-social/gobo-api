# Gobo relies on the consent of our members to bridge functionality across
# provider platforms. The identities denote that consent, and at any time,
# that consent may be revoked, rendering this identity inert.
# 
# This decorator creates a resuable double-duty check that we can seamlessly
# compose this behavior to arbitrary tasks:
# 1. Prior to attempting a request, we must confirm that the identity is
#    still valid.
# 2. If we run into an response where we can infer consent has been revoked
#    independent of a Gobo flow, either explicitly or implicitly through expiration.
# 
# In both cases, we want to isolate the identity, avoid issuing requests that
# result in error-class responses (that look suspicious to providers), and
# visually represent the identity as invalid.
